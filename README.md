# N-Body Simulation with Boost and Python Animation

## Project Description
This project implements an N-body simulation using C++ with the Boost library for numerical integration. It also includes a Python script for visualizing the simulation results with an animated 3D plot of the system's evolution over time.

### Features:
- Implements an N-body gravitational simulation using Runge-Kutta 8th-order integration.
- Uses Boost's numerical ODE solver for efficient computation.
- Dynamically reads input data from a file (`input.txt`).
- Outputs simulation data to `simulation_output.csv`.
- Provides a Python-based 3D animated visualization of the system's motion and energy evolution.

## Installation
### 1. Install Boost Library
Ensure that the Boost library is installed. If it's not installed, download and extract it next to the code files or install it via your package manager:

#### Windows:
Download Boost from [Boost's official site](https://www.boost.org/) and extract it.

#### Linux:
```bash
sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev
```

## Compilation & Execution

### 2. Compile the C++ Code
Navigate to the project directory and compile the C++ simulation:
```bash
g++ -o integrate.exe integrate.cpp -I.\
```
Run the simulation:
```bash
./integrate.exe
```
This generates an output file named `simulation_output.csv`.

---

## Visualization
### 3. Install Python Requirements
The visualization script (`show.py`) requires the following Python libraries:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib pandas
```

### 4. Run the Visualization Script
```bash
python show.py
```
This script reads `simulation_output.csv` and animates the simulation, showing the evolution of bodies in 3D space and the energy over time.

## Files Included
- `integrate.cpp`: C++ code for the N-body simulation.
- `input.txt`: Initial conditions (masses, positions, and velocities).
- `show.py`: Python script for visualization.
- `simulation_output.csv`: Output of the simulation (generated by `integrate.exe`).
